        <h2>Hi,</h2>
        <p>
        I am Aleksei and this is my pet project.<br>
        Originally, I was going to get some practice after finishing a few study cources on programming.<br>
        But, after all, I deciced to stay this modest resorce online and present it as my CV.<br>
        My contacts are below the page.

        Features:
        <ul>
            <li>Blogs creation, editing and deletion</li>
            <li>Commenting on blogs, comments deletion</li>
            <li>Bloggers' pages</li>
        </ul>
        </p><p>
        Stack and technologies:
        <ul>
        <li><b>Django</b></li>
        The standard set of MTV - Models, Templates, Views - is used.<br>
        The views have been initially created as functions and then rebuilt as classes.<br>
        The tests are based on django.test library<br>
        There is quite basic logging-to-file set up.
        <li><b>PostgreSQL</b></li>
        Nothing to add here, actually.
        <li><b>Bootstrap</b></li>
        As you can notice, Bootstrap styles are applied. The frontend appearance wasn't the goal of the project, but anyway.
        <li><b>Github</b></li>
        The source code is released <a href='https://github.com/galsrv/blog'>here</a>.
        <li></li>
