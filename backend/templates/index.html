        <h2>Hi,</h2>
        <p>
        I am Aleksei and this is my pet project.<br>
        Originally, I was going to get some practice after finishing a few study cources on programming.<br>
        But, after all, I deciced to keep this modest resorce online and present it as an addition to my CV.<br>
        My contacts are below the page.

        Site features:
        <ul>
            <li>Blogs creation, editing and deletion</li>
            <li>Commenting on blogs, comments deletion</li>
            <li>Bloggers' pages</li>
        </ul>
        </p><p>
        Stack and technologies:
        <ul>
        <li><b>Django</b></li>
        The project is based on Python 3.12 and Django 5.1.<br>
        The standard set of MTV - Models, Templates, Views - is used.<br>
        The views have been initially created as functions and then rebuilt as classes.<br>
        The tests are based on django.test library<br>
        There is quite basic logging-to-file set up.
        <li><b>PostgreSQL</b></li>
        Default DB setup is applied.
        <li><b>Bootstrap</b></li>
        As you can notice, Bootstrap styles are applied. The frontend appearance wasn't the goal of the project, but anyway.
        <li><b>HTMX</b></li>
        You can refresh the bloggers list or update your bio (you have to be authenticated) without reloading the whole page.
        Just wanted to proof this concept by this small piece of HTMX functionality.
        <li><b>Github</b></li>
        The source code is released <a href='https://github.com/galsrv/blog'>here</a>.
        <li><b>Docker</b></li>
        The set of containers and volumes is built by Docker Compose
        <li><b>VPS</b></li>
        The project is deployed on virtual private server with domain name and SSL certificate. 
        Nginx is used as a web-server and reverse proxy server.
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>Contacts</h2>
        <p>
        You can reach me by sending a message using this <a href={% url 'contacts' %}>form</a>. It makes sense to include your contacts in the message.
        </p>
