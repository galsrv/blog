        <h2>Hi,</h2>
        <p>
        I am Aleksei and this is my pet projects site.<br>
        There are two projects here. Now you are on the main page of the first one, <b>The Blog</b>.<br>
        The second one, the more complex project, is the <b>HR Bot</b>. You can reach it by this <a href='https://galsrv.com/bot/admin/settings/'>link</a>.<br>
        Both projects are on <b>Python 3.12</b><br>
        My contact is below the page.
        </p>

        <h2>Content</h2>
        <p>
        Site content is AI-generated and doesn't make any sense.
        </p>  
        <h2>Contacts</h2>
        <p>
        Originally there was a web form here. I thought it would be a good idea to let the user fill the form and the e-mail would be sent to me. How naive I was. How many CEO optimization spam I received...<br>
        Let's try again. You can reach me by sending a message to account with the user name as this site domain stands on Google main mail domain. Will see how it goes.
